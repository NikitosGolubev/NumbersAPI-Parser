# My memories
After my last project which was (Number-Facts-API), I've decided to develop an extension to it. I wanted to make it at pretty much the same design but with a different approach for the back-end. First of all, I relate this project with my solid decision to take the path of becoming a professional Laravel developer. I really like this framework, and from now on I've firmly taken such a responsible decision. The idea for this project has come to me when I wanted to test Numbers-Facts-API. I needed data to the database and I was so lazy to fill it manually. So, the thought of building an app that would deliver this data for me (parser), seemed great. Without further ado, I've started working

# Project description
Well, before I started working, I decided to make a little research on how can I increase my knowledge with this project. And this action benefited a lot. First of all, in my last project, I've promised that I would find a way how to include my JS files without <script> tags and I found it! I've learned a lot about CommonJS modules and about exports which are not fully supported in modern browsers yet. I've decided to use exports. This has led me to the point where I had to learn what 'bundler' is and luckily I've faced with browserify which I awesomely integrated into my GULP build. Also, then I figured out that I also need babelify(feature for browserify) to make exports work. To be honest, the process of configuring all of these things (babelify, browserify) was pretty tough but finally, I got what was expected: fully supported functionality of export/export default constructions.

Also, I've decided to refuse from using Lumen in this project (like it was in Numbers-Facts-API) and I've started exploring Laravel. It's still a long journey for me but I've learned a lot only from this project yet.

Besides, I've finally replaced Sublime Text Editor with professional IDE (phpStorm). AND I DON'T REGRET. In fact, I really regret I've not done this earlier because it's significantly simplified the process of coding. Although I've spent some time learning a bunch of shortcuts, this has paid back to me later.

Now, I wanna mention some significant things I've done and realized during development.
1. I really need to learn any JS framework, at least basics. Writing my own MVC from scratch was very, very hard (it's funny when you do this first time, but when things started to get repeated, it's not really enjoyable). The mental debt is huge, and I definitely need to cut it down. I plan to get started with Vue JS because it seems like it perfectly fits with Laravel.
2. GULP is great, but ... Webpack is much better. So, I also need to explore this bundler.
3. App architecture, in fact, is a quite complicated thing, I obviously need to learn more about refactoring and about building clean independent architecture itself.

So, that's all with it. My back-end journey continues, keep progressing!
